      <h1> About Me </h1>
        My name is Michael Marucci. I am from a small town in Bergen County, New Jersey
      that goes by the name of Oradell. I am what some refer to as a suburbanite. I am
      the oldest of three and I grew up at home with my Mom Dad, younger sister Grace,
      and younger brother Dean. I am a Junior here at the University of Rhode Island 
      studying Accounting and potentially a minor in computer science. In my free time 
      I enjoy skiing, boating, and working on cars.
