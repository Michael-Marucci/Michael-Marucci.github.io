      <h1> About Me </h1>
        My name is Michael Marucci. I am from a small town 
        in Bergen County, New Jersethat goes by the name of Oradell. I am
        what some refer to as a suburbanite. I am the oldest of three and
        I grew up at home with my Mom Dad, younger sister Grace,
      and younger brother Dean. I am a Junior here at the University
        of Rhode Island studying Accounting and potentially a 
        minor in computer science. In my free time 
      I enjoy skiing, boating, and working on cars.
